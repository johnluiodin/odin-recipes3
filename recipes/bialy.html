    <h1>Bialy, A Bite Into Poland</h1>  
    </p>
    <h4> <p>Many make the mistake of calling a bialy.. a bagel. Bialy is its own food item. The bread of a bialy is baked while bagel bread is boiled, and unlike the bagel, bialy has a deppression </p> </h4>
     <h4>   <p>in the center of the bread as opposed to a hole. Bialy is most traditionally cooked with onions, which are placed into the depression prior to baking. Some may opt to include garlic, </p> </h4>
     <h4> <p> poppy seeds, or bread crumbs.</p></h4>
     <p><h1>Brief History of Bialy</h1></p>
     <h4><p>From the 1800s to the first quarter of the 20th century, America experienced a steady influx of Jewish immigrants seeking refuge from a world that knew nothing but poverty, and war. </p></h4>
     <h4><p>Immigrants brought over many delicious recipes to the United States, one being the bialy. By the 1920s, New Yorks population had increased to almost 5 million as opposed to its population </p></h4>
    <h4><p>in 1880;80,000. Hundreds of Jewish, Italian, and Polish cuisine-inspired bakeries opened following this influx of immigrants, almost always including some variation of the bialy. Sadly, </p></h4>
    <h4><p>only a handful of original bakeries are around, but bialy is considered a staple of their delicatessen.</p></h4>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
   <h3>-Dough</h3>
<ul>
  <h4> <li>7 cups (840g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour</li></h4> 
  <h4> <li>2 3/4 teaspoons (17g) salt</li></h4> 
  <h4> <li> 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast </li></h4> 
  <h4> <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder </li> </h4>
  <h4>  <li> 2 1/4 cups (510g) water </li> </h4>
  </ul>
 <h3> Filling </h3>
<ul>
  <h4> <li>1 onion, peeled and quartered </li> </h4>
    <h4> <li>1 teaspoon poppy seeds </li> </h4>
      <h4> <li>1/8 teaspoon salt </li> </h4>
        <h4> <li>3 to 4 grinds coarsely ground black pepper </li> </h4>
          <h4> <li>1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil </li> </h4>
            <h4> <li>farina or yellow cornmeal, for pans </li> </h4>
    </ul>
    <h1>-Steps</h1>
    <ol>
     <p><h4><li>To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine the flour, salt, yeast, and onion powder in the bowl of a stand</li> </h4> </p>
     <h4> mixer fitted with a beater attachment. Switch to a dough hook, add the water and mix until just combined, 1 or 2 minutes at low speed. Stop the mixer, cover the bowl, and let sit for 20 minutes.  </h4> 
     <p> <h4> <li> After this rest, uncover the bowl and continue kneading at medium speed for 8 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. </li></h4> </p>
     <p><h4><li>Cover and refrigerate the dough (in an oiled bowl if desired) overnight for a slow, cool rise that will develop the dough's flavor. </li></h4> </p>
     <p><h4><li> Next day, divide the dough into 12 pieces (they'll weigh just under 4 ounces each) and round each into a ball. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cover with greased plastic, and let  </li></h4> </p>
      <h4>rise at room temperature for 1 hour, or until puffy </h4>
    <p><h4><li>Preheat the oven to 475Â°F.</li></h4></p>
    <p><h4><li>To make the filling: Pulse the onion in a food processor until very finely chopped, but not liquid. Mix in the poppy seed, salt, and pepper. Heat the oil in a saucepan and cook the onion </li></h4></p>
       <h4>mixture for a few minutes over medium-low heat until the liquid cooks off and the onion is very slightly caramelized. Remove from the heat and cool.</h4>
    <p><h4><li>To shape and bake: Lightly sprinkle 2 baking sheets with farina or cornmeal. Take each dough ball and stretch it into a bagel shape about 6" to 7" in diameter, without puncturing the center </li></h4> </p>
     <h4> and leaving a wide, flat indentation where the hole would be. Place a few inches apart on the prepared baking sheets, 6 per pan. Place a scant teaspoon of the onion filling in the indentation and </h4>
    <h4>  spread it out with your fingers. Don't overfill; a little goes a long way.</h4>
    <p><h4><li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until light golden brown. Remove the bialys from the oven and serve warm; or cool on a rack and save for toasting later.</li></h4></p>
