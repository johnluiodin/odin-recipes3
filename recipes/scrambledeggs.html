        <p><h4>Scrambled eggs are a delicious, common breakfast meal. Paired with toast or waffles and a cup of coffee, scrambled eggs can be a great start to your day.</h4> </p>
        <h4>Depending on preference, scrambled eggs can be cooked longer for a more solid texture, while some turn the heat off early to gain a creamy, runny consistency.</h4>
        <h1>-Ingredients</h1>
        <p>
         
             <h4><ul>
                <li>8 large eggs</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>
        </h4>  </p> 
        <h1>-Steps</h1>
        <p>  
            <ol>
            <p><h4><li>Lightly beat the eggs, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl.</li></h4></p>
            <p><h4><li>Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium nonstick skillet over low heat; swirl to coat the bottom and sides. </li></h4></p>
            <p><h4><li>   Add the eggs, and cook slowly, scraping them up with a rubber spatula occasionally, until most of the liquid has thickened and the eggs are soft, about 10 minutes. </li></h4></p>
            <p><h4><li>    If you like your eggs a little firmer, cook them for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Remove them from the heat, and gently fold in the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Serve hot.</li></h4></p>
            </ol>
